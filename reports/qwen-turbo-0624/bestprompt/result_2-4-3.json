However, based on the provided options, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding since the question does not specify any jugs were present initially or that they were to be removed.\n3. **Determine the remaining items**: Since there's no mention of jugs being present or to be removed, we focus on the pencils.

Based on the items listed (burgundy pencils and magenta pencils), none of the options directly apply because there are no fuchsia items mentioned.
