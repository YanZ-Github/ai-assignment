To determine the color of the item directly to the left of the cup, we need to arrange these items in sequence based on their colors.\n\nSince the orange cup is one of the items mentioned, it must be placed somewhere in the sequence. The fuchsia sheet of paper and the mauve textbook cannot be next to each other because they have different colors, and there's no mention of any other items between them. Therefore, the sequence could be:\n\n1. Fuchsia (sheet of paper)\n2. Mauve (textbook)\n3.
