The items next to the paperclip are a gold keychain and a silver necklace.\n\nGiven this setup, the item furthest from the paperclip would be either the gold keychain or the silver necklace, depending on which side you measure from. Since both options are listed as \"gold\" and \"silver,\" respectively, we can deduce that without additional context about their relative positions, the question likely intends to ask for the color of the item that is not directly adjacent to the paperclip but is still part of the row.\n\nGiven the options, the only color explicitly mentioned that is not \"black\" (the color of the paperclip) and does not directly border the paperclip in the description provided is \"gold.\" Therefore, the item furthest from the paperclip, based on the options given, is the gold keychain.\n\nThe answer is: (N).",
