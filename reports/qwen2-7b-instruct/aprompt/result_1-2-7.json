Given the nature of the question and the options provided, the intended answer might have been misunderstood due to the lack of specificity in the question regarding how to interpret \"furthest.\"\n\nGiven the available options and assuming the question sought to identify a color among those provided rather than the specific items, the closest match to the scenario described would be to identify the color of any item (aside from turquoise) as the question seems to imply considering colors in isolation rather than specific items.\n\nSince the question does not specify a clear method to choose between \"red\" and \"black\" as the furthest colors from turquoise based on the provided options, and given the options include colors like green, brown, gold, and others, it seems there might have been a misinterpretation in formulating the question or the answer choices.
